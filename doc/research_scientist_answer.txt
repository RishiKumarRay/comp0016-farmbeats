1. Do you perform experiments/collect data on bigger test samples - actual farms? If not, would you be interested in being able to do so?
- we do collect some data on samples but not as much as we want. We would like to streamline the process (make more efficient). 
- type of data: rainfall with rain meter, soil pH with pH meter.
2. How do you collect the data? Do you have to travel directly to the farm to collect the data yourself?
- yes, we manually collect data. Travel from office to farm: an hour commute every day. Physically see reading with meter etc.
3. Would you be interested in having access to data collected on the farm such as soil humidity, soil ph, luminosity, air humidty and others remotely? 
- i would love to have the opportunity to have an improved infrastructure on data collection method. 
4. In what form would you want data to be presented to help with your job?
- a range of different visualisations from which i can choose would be useful, for example pie charts and line graphs. e.g. see how rainfall and pH varies throughout the year 
5. What other features would you like to have in such a remote system?
- Some pre-analysis of the data by trained models woul help to predict costs, weather patterns, etc

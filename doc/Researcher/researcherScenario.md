# Jack Donalds
Jack Donalds is 35 year-old agricultural reserarcher with and is quite experienced with using electronic devices and computer systems.
He wants to collect some data on soil humidity and ambient temperature on the farm he is using as his case study. He accesses the farm's website on his computer, and briefly looks through all data shown on the first page to look for any anomalies.

Satisified that there aren't any error messages suggesting some problems, he clicks on the humidity sensor data, selects an option to display ambient temperature on the same graph. Satisfied with the data values, he downloads the data as an XML file and uses it for further analysis offline.

1. Do you perform experiments/collect data on bigger test samples - actual farms? If not, would you be interested in being able to do so?
2. How do you collect the data? Do you have to travel directly to the farm to collect the data yourself?
3. Would you be interested in having access to data collected on the farm such as soil humidity, soil ph, luminosity, air humidty and others remotely? 
4. In what form would you want data to be presented to help with your job? pie charts? line graphs? etc
5. What other features would you like to have in such a remote system? Would some pre-analysis of the data by trained models help?

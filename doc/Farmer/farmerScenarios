Cea Amarin
Cea is a 75-year-old farmer who is very experienced with agriculture. She wants to find a way to maintain the farm by herself, as she is elderly and finds herself lacking of physical strength after a working for a long time. She mounted our devices to the farm and logged into our web-app to monitor the situation of the field. She monitors situations in the farm easily by seeing data and charts on the website. She also connects her original watering device into the system so she can finish daily job at home on her own. She is also able to determine the situation by the colour of the indicator light on the web-app and follows suggestions given which are determined by our model. This makes her work life more convenient and simple.

Ideas for requirement:
2 Main Ideas

1. Farm Data Analysis System
    - sensors collect data from Farm   
    - data sent to raspberry pi 
    - calculations are made
    - raspberry pi produces an output
    - output sent to actuators
    - actuators carry out response action

2. Digital Shepherd 
    - use data online to train a model 
      that recognises, classifies and 
      counts animals (azure cloud)
    - deploy machine learning algorithms
      in ai camera
    - this can be incorperated in
      a drone to be a digital shepherd
